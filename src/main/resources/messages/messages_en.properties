introduccion=Our veterinary service for dogs and cats is based on preventive medicine in order to protect your pet from different diseases before the first symptoms appear. For this, we offer the vaccination of puppies, as well as that of adult dogs and cats. Based on this principle of prevention, we also highlight the importance of internal and external deworming on a regular basis in your pet.

At the same time, we have the most complete urine and blood tests, in this way we solidly support periodic check-ups, which, as prevention, ensure that your dog or cat can enjoy a life in full health.

At Bonn Veterinary Clinic we offer specific nutritional advice for each pet based on their needs, with high-end feed and specific diets for each case.
